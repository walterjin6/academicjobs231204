The member institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. These universities are considered some of the most prestigious universities, not just in the US, but globally.

The Ivy League was originally an athletic conference, a body of sports teams playing competitively in a league against opposing teams. These eight American universities were known for their highly competitive sports programmes, and as they continued to perform well in the athletic world, they began to attract further funding, grants and top lecturers from around the globe. As a result, the institutions soon gained a reputation for academic achievement alongside sporting success.</p>
