                    Academic Jobs was founded by a team of higher ed professionals who were frustrated with the lack of transparency and efficiency in the academic job market. Put simply, they thought that the old job boards out there for academic positions did not work for clients, and they continued to operate on very old, outdated technology. They therefore have created the best academic job platform in the world today... making it easier for candidates to search for jobs, compare offers, and communicate with employers. They have also provided employers with a cost-effective and user-friendly way to advertise their vacancies, reach a global talent pool, and manage their applications.
